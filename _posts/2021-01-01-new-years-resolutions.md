I have a poor record with New Year's resolutions. I trust that nailing them to this site will keep me accountable (or, at very least, punish my failure with shame).

#### 2021 Resolutions

1. Put half my income each month in a savings account.
2. Find a meaningful summer internship; start recruiting in March for the fall.
3. Blog twice a month about my readings, projects, and thoughts.
4. Read three books each month, exploring new subjects.
5. Spend thirty minutes a day talking to family.
6. Practice gratitude in my morning meditations.
7. Stop biting my goddamn nails.
8. Sleep on a consistent schedule, deviating at most once a week.
10. Abandon Coke.
10. Bench 225 for 10 reps.

Wish me luck.
